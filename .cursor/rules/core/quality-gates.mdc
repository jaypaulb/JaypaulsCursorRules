# Quality Gates

## Universal Requirements
- Execute quality gates before completion
- Auto-fix issues when possible
- Escalate when blocked
- Handle edge cases in test assertions (zero values, empty states)
- **Enforce atomic design structure**: Verify files follow size guidelines (see `code-structure.mdc` for specific limits)
- **Check composition hierarchy**: Ensure atoms → molecules → organisms → pages structure is maintained (see `code-structure.mdc`)
- **Enforce TDD methodology**: Tests must be written before implementation (see `tdd-methodology.mdc`)
- **Verify test coverage**: All code must have >80% test coverage

## Quality Gate Checklist
- [ ] **TDD followed**: Tests written before implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)
- [ ] **Tests pass**: All tests must pass before completion
- [ ] **Test coverage**: >80% coverage (100% for critical paths and public APIs)
- [ ] **Test structure**: Tests follow atomic design hierarchy (atoms/molecules/organisms)
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Security scans pass
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Status Indicators
- ✅ All quality gates passed
- ⚠️ Issues found and fixed
- 🚧 Blocked, requires intervention

## Pre-Commit Validation
All changes must pass quality gates before:
- Marking tasks complete
- Creating merge requests
- Closing issues
