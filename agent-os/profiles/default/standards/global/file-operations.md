# File Operations Standards

File read/write standards. Always read before write, use token-aware filtering for large files, validate paths.

## Read Before Write

- Always read files before modifying them
- Re-read after changes to verify integrity
- Use token-aware filtering for large files (≤200 lines output)
- Check file existence and permissions before operations

## Token-Aware Filtering

For large files, use filtering:
- `head -n 200` - First 200 lines
- `wc -l` - Line count
- `head -c 10K` - First 10KB
- Start broad, narrow down based on relevance

## Path Validation

- Use workspace-relative paths (not location-relative)
- Always confirm working directory with `pwd`
- Validate target directory exists before writing

## Documentation Standards

- Keep durable documentation in repository
- Ephemeral TODOs stay in conversation only
- Never create unsolicited `.md` files without explicit request

## Atomic Design File Creation

When creating new files, follow atomic design hierarchy (see `code-structure.md` for complete guidelines):

### File Creation Checklist

- [ ] Is this file small and focused? (Check size limits in `code-structure.md`)
- [ ] Does it have a single, clear responsibility?
- [ ] Can it be composed from smaller pieces instead?
- [ ] Is it at the appropriate hierarchy level (atoms → molecules → organisms)?
- [ ] Does it follow the composition rules (atoms import only stdlib/external, molecules import atoms, etc.)?
