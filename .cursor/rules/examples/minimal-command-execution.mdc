# Command Execution Standards

## Core Pattern
All executed commands must use:
```bash
timeout 30s <command> 2>&1 | cat
```

## Requirements
- Use non-interactive flags (`-y`, `--yes`) where safe
- Use non-paging flags where safe
- Validate command outputs before proceeding
- Always check exit codes
- Capture stderr with `2>&1`
- Use timeout to prevent hanging
- Pipe to `cat` to prevent paging
