name: Global Tech Stack
description: Document and maintain a comprehensive inventory of all technologies used in your project to enable effective team onboarding and technology decisions. Include your runtime/framework (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, etc.), backend framework (Express, Django, Spring, etc.), frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.), and CSS approach (Tailwind, Bootstrap, BEM, CSS modules, etc.). Document your database choices (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.), ORM or query builder (Prisma, SQLAlchemy, Hibernate, Knex, etc.), and caching strategy (Redis, Memcached, etc.). List testing frameworks and tools (Jest, Pytest, Mocha, etc.), code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Rust type system, etc.), and monitoring/logging solutions. Document your deployment infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel, Heroku, etc.), CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.), and containerization approach (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.). Include third-party services for authentication (Auth0, Firebase, custom), email delivery (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.), payment processing (Stripe, etc.), and monitoring (DataDog, New Relic, etc.). Update this documentation whenever you add or change technologies so your team always has accurate information. Use this skill when documenting a project's technology choices and rationale, selecting a framework or runtime for new projects, choosing frontend libraries and tools, evaluating databases and storage solutions, selecting testing frameworks and QA tools, setting up CI/CD and deployment infrastructure, integrating third-party services, updating project technology documentation, onboarding new developers to understand the tech stack, evaluating technology alternatives and migration paths, and managing dependencies and versions.
