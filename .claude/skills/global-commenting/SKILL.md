name: Global Commenting
description: Write code that documents itself through clear naming and structure before adding comments. When comments are necessary, write minimal, concise comments that explain complex algorithms, non-obvious design decisions, or the "why" behind implementation choices rather than the "what". Avoid temporal comments about recent changes, bug fixes, or TODOs, and instead focus on evergreen content that remains accurate and useful long-term. Use comments to explain business logic, domain-specific constraints, performance considerations, and complex conditional logic. Use this skill when writing code with complex logic that needs explanation, adding JSDoc/docstring comments for public APIs, reviewing comments in existing code, removing outdated or obvious comments, ensuring code clarity before adding comments, and maintaining self-documenting code practices across your codebase.

# Global Commenting

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global commenting.

## When to use this skill:

- When adding comments to explain complex logic or algorithms
- When documenting the purpose of functions or classes
- When adding JSDoc or similar documentation comments
- When removing outdated or temporal comments
- When replacing comments with clearer code
- When explaining business logic or domain-specific decisions
- When documenting assumptions or constraints
- When providing context for non-obvious code patterns
- When removing "what" comments that should be obvious from code
- When adding comments that explain "why" decisions were made
- When ensuring code is self-documenting before adding comments
