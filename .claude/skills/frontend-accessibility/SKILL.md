name: Frontend Accessibility
description: Build user interfaces that are accessible to all users including those with disabilities, visual impairments, hearing impairments, and motor impairments. Use semantic HTML elements (nav, main, article, section, button, form, label) instead of generic divs to provide meaning to assistive technologies like screen readers. Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements without requiring a mouse. Provide visible focus indicators so keyboard users can see which element has focus. Maintain color contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1 (WCAG AA standard) between text and background to support users with low vision. Provide alternative text descriptions for all images and icon buttons. Implement ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-describedby, role, aria-expanded, aria-hidden) when semantic HTML isn't sufficient for complex interactive components. Structure headings logically (h1, h2, h3, etc.) in a hierarchical order without skipping levels. Manage focus properly in dynamic content like modals, dropdowns, and single-page applications. Use this skill when writing semantic HTML markup with proper heading structure, implementing keyboard navigation and tab order, adding visible focus indicators and outlines, checking and ensuring color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards, writing alternative text for images and icon buttons, implementing ARIA attributes for complex components (modals, dropdowns, tabs, custom widgets), creating accessible form labels and error messages, building accessible interactive components, managing focus in dynamic or single-page applications, and testing with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.
