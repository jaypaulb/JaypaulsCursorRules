name: Global Conventions
description: Establish consistent conventions and processes that enable team coordination and knowledge sharing. Organize your project with a clear, logical directory structure that scales with your codebase (src/components, src/pages, src/services, etc.). Maintain up-to-date README files that document project setup, architecture overview, and key development tasks. Follow version control best practices: use descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" and "what" of changes, create feature branches for new work, keep commits focused and atomic, and conduct code reviews before merging. Manage environment variables through .env files and document required variables without committing secrets. Handle dependencies carefully by pinning versions, regularly updating and auditing dependencies for security vulnerabilities, and minimizing transitive dependencies. Set up code review processes that ensure quality while moving work forward efficiently. Write tests for new features and critical paths during development (not comprehensive edge case coverage initially). Use feature flags to hide incomplete features behind toggles instead of long-lived branches, enabling safe deployments. Maintain changelog files documenting user-facing changes and migration steps. Document architecture decisions and key technical choices so future developers understand the reasoning. Use this skill when organizing project directory structures, creating and updating README and documentation files, writing clear git commit messages, creating and managing feature branches, managing environment variables and configuration, handling dependencies and version management, setting up and conducting code review processes, creating tests for new features, using feature flags for gradual rollouts and incomplete features, maintaining changelog files, documenting architecture decisions, and establishing development workflow standards.
