name: Global Coding Style
description: Apply consistent naming conventions, formatting, and code structure across all files in the codebase. Write code with meaningful variable and function names, keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities, maintain consistent indentation and formatting (using automated tools like Prettier or Black), remove dead code and unused imports immediately, apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to eliminate duplication, and avoid unnecessary backward compatibility hacks unless explicitly required. Use this skill when writing any code file, refactoring existing code, editing functions or classes, defining naming conventions for new features, removing dead code, and establishing or enforcing project-wide coding standards.

- When writing new functions or methods
- When removing unused code and variables
- When applying DRY principles to reduce code duplication
- When refactoring to make code more readable
- When establishing naming conventions across the project
- When removing backward compatibility hacks
- When simplifying code logic and structure
- When editing any code files across the project
