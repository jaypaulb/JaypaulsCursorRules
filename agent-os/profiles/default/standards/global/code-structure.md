# Code Structure Standards (Atomic Design)

Hierarchical atomic design code structure. Enforces small, focused files that compose into larger logical groups following atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages hierarchy.

## Atomic Design Hierarchy

Structure all code following this hierarchy:

### Atoms (Basic Building Blocks)
- **Purpose**: Single-purpose, indivisible components
- **Size**: <100 lines (ideally <50 lines)
- **Responsibility**: One class, one function, or one small utility
- **Dependencies**: Only standard library or external packages
- **Naming**: Context-agnostic, reusable names
- **Example**: `atoms/user.py` - Basic User class with minimal methods

### Molecules (Composed Components)
- **Purpose**: Small groups of atoms working together
- **Size**: <200 lines (ideally <150 lines)
- **Responsibility**: One specific feature or component
- **Dependencies**: Import and compose 2-5 atoms
- **Naming**: Describe the composition/relationship
- **Example**: `molecules/user_validator.py` - Validates user using atoms/user and atoms/validator

### Organisms (Complex Modules)
- **Purpose**: Complex components composed from molecules/atoms
- **Size**: <500 lines (ideally <300 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Complete business logic for a domain area
- **Dependencies**: Import and compose multiple molecules
- **Naming**: Describe the domain/functionality
- **Example**: `organisms/auth_system.py` - Complete authentication system

### Templates (Reusable Patterns)
- **Purpose**: Structural patterns that can be reused
- **Size**: <200 lines
- **Responsibility**: Define reusable code patterns
- **Dependencies**: May use atoms, molecules, or organisms
- **Naming**: Pattern-focused names
- **Example**: `templates/endpoint_template.py` - API endpoint pattern

### Pages (Complete Features)
- **Purpose**: Complete features composed from organisms/molecules/atoms
- **Size**: <500 lines (compose from smaller pieces)
- **Responsibility**: Complete user-facing feature
- **Dependencies**: Import organisms, molecules, and atoms as needed
- **Naming**: Feature-focused names
- **Example**: `pages/login_page.py` - Complete login feature

## File Size Enforcement

### Before Creating a File
- [ ] Is this file small and focused? (Check size limits above)
- [ ] Does it have a single, clear responsibility?
- [ ] Can it be broken down into smaller atoms/molecules?
- [ ] Is it at the appropriate hierarchy level?

### If File Exceeds Size Limit
- **Split into atoms**: Extract basic building blocks
- **Create molecules**: Compose atoms into focused components
- **Build organisms**: Compose molecules into complex modules
- **Never create large monolithic files**

## Composition Rules

### Import Hierarchy
- **Atoms**: Import only standard library or external dependencies
- **Molecules**: Import atoms and compose them
- **Organisms**: Import molecules and/or atoms
- **Pages**: Import organisms, molecules, and atoms as needed

### Composition Guidelines
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep import depth shallow (atoms → molecules → organisms, not deeper)
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Each level should be independently testable

## Directory Structure

```
src/
├── atoms/          # Basic building blocks (<100 lines each)
├── molecules/      # Composed components (<200 lines each)
├── organisms/      # Complex modules (<500 lines each)
├── templates/     # Reusable patterns (<200 lines each)
└── pages/         # Complete features (<500 lines each)

tests/
├── atoms/          # Unit tests for atoms (mirror src/atoms/)
├── molecules/      # Integration tests for molecules (mirror src/molecules/)
├── organisms/      # System tests for organisms (mirror src/organisms/)
└── pages/          # E2E tests for pages (mirror src/pages/)
```

## Test Structure (TDD)

Tests follow atomic design hierarchy and mirror source structure. See testing standards for TDD principles:

- **Atoms**: Unit tests - test individual functions/classes in isolation
- **Molecules**: Integration tests - test composed components (2-5 atoms)
- **Organisms**: System tests - test complex modules (multiple molecules)
- **Pages**: E2E tests - test complete features

### Test Organization Rules
- One test file per source file
- Tests mirror source directory structure
- Test names describe behavior being tested
- Tests written before implementation (TDD)

## Benefits

✅ **Small, focused files** - Easy to understand and maintain
✅ **Clear hierarchy** - Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Pages
✅ **Reusability** - Atoms and molecules can be reused across contexts
✅ **Testability** - Each level can be tested independently
✅ **Maintainability** - Changes are localized to small files
✅ **Scalability** - System grows by composition, not by file size
