# Issue Tracking Standards

> **Note**: Assumes core rules (command execution) and workflow rules are already loaded.

## Issue Creation Requirements

### Before Creating Issues
```bash
# Always check for existing issues first
glab issue list --search "Task X.X.X" --state all
gh issue list --search "Task X.X.X" --state all
```

### Issue Template
```markdown
# Task X.X.X: Brief Description

## Requirements
- [ ] Specific requirement 1
- [ ] Specific requirement 2

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given: Initial state
- When: Action taken
- Then: Expected result

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Quality gates passed
```

## Issue Management Lifecycle

### Issue States
- **Open**: Ready for work or in progress
- **In Progress**: Actively being worked on
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to external dependency
- **Review**: Implementation complete, awaiting review
- **Closed**: Work completed and verified

### Issue Labels
- `type:feature` - New functionality
- `type:bug` - Bug fixes
- `type:enhancement` - Improvements
- `priority:high/medium/low` - Priority levels
- `status:blocked` - Cannot proceed
- `status:review` - Ready for review

## GitLab Integration

### Issue Creation
```bash
glab issue create \
  --title "Task X.X.X: Brief Description" \
  --description "Implements requirements from TASKS.md" \
  --label "type:feature,priority:medium"
```

### Issue Updates
```bash
glab issue edit <issue-number> --label "+status:blocked"
glab issue comment <issue-number> --message "Progress update"
glab issue close <issue-number>
```

## GitHub Integration

### Issue Creation
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Task X.X.X: Brief Description" \
  --body "Implements requirements from TASKS.md" \
  --label "feature,medium-priority"
```

### Issue Updates
```bash
gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label "blocked"
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "Progress update"
gh issue close <issue-number>
```

## Issue-Task Synchronization

### Linking Issues to Tasks
- TASKS.md references issue number
- Issue description references task identifier
- Commit messages reference both task and issue

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement login endpoint (Task 1.2.3, Issue #42)"
```

### Status Synchronization
- Task reserved → Issue created
- Task in progress → Issue labeled "in-progress"
- Task blocked → Issue labeled "blocked" with comment
- Task completed → Issue closed

## Before Closing Issues
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Task marked as completed in TASKS.md
