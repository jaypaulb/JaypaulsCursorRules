# Project Management Standards

> **Note**: Assumes core rules (file operations, quality gates) and workflow rules are already loaded.

## Documentation Requirements

### Essential Files
- **PRD.md**: Product Requirements Document with goals and success criteria
- **TASKS.md**: Single source of truth for all project tasks
- **README.md**: Project setup, usage, and contribution guidelines
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history and notable changes

### Documentation Standards
- Keep documentation in sync with implementation
- Update relevant docs when making architectural changes
- Use clear, actionable language
- Include examples and code snippets where helpful

## Workflow Principles

### Development Lifecycle
1. **Planning**: Define requirements in PRD.md
2. **Task Breakdown**: Create detailed tasks in TASKS.md
3. **Implementation**: Work through tasks systematically
4. **Testing**: Validate implementation against requirements
5. **Documentation**: Update docs to reflect changes
6. **Review**: Ensure quality standards are met

## Issue Management

### Issue Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Every task must have corresponding issue
2. **Assignment**: Link issues to tasks in TASKS.md
3. **Progress**: Update issue status as work progresses
4. **Resolution**: Close issues when tasks are completed

### Issue Standards
- Use descriptive titles that clearly state the problem/feature
- Include acceptance criteria in issue description
- Reference related tasks and documentation
- Use labels for categorization (bug, feature, enhancement)

## Branch Management

### Naming Conventions
- `feature/{issue-number}-{brief-description}`
- `bugfix/{issue-number}-{brief-description}`
- `hotfix/{issue-number}-{brief-description}`
- Always include issue number for traceability

### Merge Strategy
- Use squash merges to keep history clean
- Include issue reference in merge commit message
- Delete feature branches after successful merge

## Release Management

### Version Control
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Tag releases in git with version numbers
- Update CHANGELOG.md with each release
- Include migration notes for breaking changes

### Release Checklist
- [ ] All planned tasks completed
- [ ] **TDD followed**: All code has tests written before implementation
- [ ] Quality gates passed
- [ ] Test coverage >80% (100% for critical paths)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)
