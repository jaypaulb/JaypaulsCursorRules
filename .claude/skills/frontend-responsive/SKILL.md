name: Frontend Responsive
description: Build user interfaces that work well on all device sizes from small phones (320px) to large desktop monitors (1920px+). Use a mobile-first development approach where you design for mobile screens first, then enhance for larger screens with media queries. Define and use consistent CSS breakpoints (e.g., 640px, 1024px, 1280px) across your entire codebase to maintain consistency. Create fluid, percentage-based layouts instead of fixed pixel widths so content scales smoothly. Use relative units (rem/em) instead of pixels for font sizes and spacing to enable proper scaling and user preference support. Implement CSS media queries strategically to adapt layouts, typography, and content for different screen sizes and orientations. Ensure touch-friendly interaction targets are at least 44x44 pixels for users on mobile devices. Optimize images and assets for mobile networks by using appropriate image sizes and formats. Prioritize content appropriately for mobile viewports, showing only essential information on small screens. Test your interfaces across multiple real devices and screen sizes (not just browser DevTools), including various phones, tablets, and desktop sizes. Use this skill when implementing mobile-first CSS and responsive layouts, defining and using consistent CSS breakpoints, creating fluid percentage-based layouts instead of fixed widths, converting pixel units to relative units (rem/em), implementing CSS media queries for different screen sizes, adapting typography and sizing for different breakpoints, ensuring touch-friendly interaction targets (44x44px minimum), testing UI on multiple real devices and orientations, optimizing images and assets for mobile networks, prioritizing content for mobile viewports, and implementing progressive enhancement strategies.
