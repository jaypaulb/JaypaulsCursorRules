# Command Execution Standards

Standard command execution patterns. Commands that don't self-terminate must use timeout. All commands require error handling and validation.

## Core Pattern

### Commands That Self-Terminate

For commands that complete on their own (most commands):

```bash
<command> 2>&1 | cat
```

### Commands That Don't Self-Terminate

For commands that run indefinitely or may hang (e.g., `log --tail`, `watch`, interactive commands):

```bash
timeout <duration> <command> 2>&1 | cat
```

**Timeout Duration Guidelines:**

- **Log tailing/monitoring**: `timeout 30s` or `timeout 60s` (adjust based on expected output)
- **Long-running operations**: `timeout 300s` (5 minutes) or appropriate duration
- **Interactive commands**: `timeout 30s` (prevents hanging)
- **Network requests**: `timeout 30s` (prevents hanging on network issues)

## Requirements

- Use non-interactive flags (`-y`, `--yes`) where safe
- Use non-paging flags where safe
- Validate command outputs before proceeding
- Always check exit codes
- Capture stderr with `2>&1`
- **Use timeout only for commands that don't self-terminate** (log tailing, watch, interactive commands)
- Pipe to `cat` to prevent paging

## Examples

### Self-Terminating Command (No Timeout)

```bash
output=$(git status 2>&1 | cat)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    # Process successful output
else
    # Handle error
fi
```

### Non-Terminating Command (With Timeout)

```bash
# Log tailing - will run indefinitely without timeout
output=$(timeout 30s docker logs --tail 100 -f container_name 2>&1 | cat)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    # Process log output
else
    # Handle error or timeout
fi
```

### Long-Running Operation (With Appropriate Timeout)

```bash
# Build operation - may take time but should complete
output=$(timeout 300s npm run build 2>&1 | cat)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    # Process build output
else
    # Handle error or timeout
fi
```
