# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Methodology

Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. Enforces Red-Green-Refactor cycle, test-first development, and atomic test structure.

> **Note**: This standard enforces TDD principles in all code development. See language-specific standards for TDD patterns.

## Core TDD Principle

**Write tests before implementation** - Tests drive design and ensure code correctness.

## Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

Follow this cycle for every feature or change:

### 1. Red - Write Failing Test First
- Write a test that describes the desired behavior
- Test must fail (proves it tests something)
- Test should be minimal and focused
- Run test to confirm it fails for the right reason

### 2. Green - Make Test Pass
- Write minimal code to make the test pass
- No premature optimization
- Focus only on making the test green
- Run test to confirm it passes

### 3. Refactor - Improve Code
- Improve code quality while keeping tests green
- Remove duplication
- Improve readability
- Maintain test coverage
- Run tests frequently during refactoring

## TDD Workflow

### Before Writing Code
1. **Understand requirement** - What behavior is needed?
2. **Write failing test** - Describe the behavior in test form
3. **Run test** - Confirm it fails (Red)
4. **Write minimal code** - Just enough to pass (Green)
5. **Run test** - Confirm it passes
6. **Refactor** - Improve code quality
7. **Run tests** - Ensure everything still passes

### Test Requirements
- **Write tests first** - Before implementation code
- **Tests must fail first** - Proves they test something
- **One test per behavior** - Focused, single responsibility
- **Descriptive test names** - Clear what is being tested
- **Fast execution** - Tests should run quickly
- **Isolated** - Tests should not depend on each other
- **Repeatable** - Same results every time

## Atomic Test Structure

Tests mirror source code structure following atomic design:

### Atoms - Unit Tests
- Test individual functions/classes in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (<1ms per test)
- Location: `tests/atoms/` or `tests/unit/atoms/`

### Molecules - Integration Tests
- Test composed components (2-5 atoms working together)
- May use real dependencies between atoms
- Mock external services
- Location: `tests/molecules/` or `tests/integration/molecules/`

### Organisms - System Tests
- Test complex modules (multiple molecules)
- May use real dependencies
- Test business logic flows
- Location: `tests/organisms/` or `tests/integration/organisms/`

### Pages - End-to-End Tests
- Test complete features
- Use real dependencies where appropriate
- Test user workflows
- Location: `tests/pages/` or `tests/e2e/`

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure
```
tests/
├── atoms/          # Unit tests for atoms
├── molecules/      # Integration tests for molecules
├── organisms/      # System tests for organisms
└── pages/          # E2E tests for pages
```

### File Naming
- Mirror source structure: `test_user.py` for `user.py`
- Use language conventions: `user_test.go`, `user.test.ts`
- Group related tests in same file

### Test Naming
- Describe what is being tested
- Include expected behavior
- Use language-appropriate conventions
- Example: `test_validate_email_returns_true_for_valid_email`

## Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum coverage**: >80% for all code
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage
- **Public APIs**: 100% coverage
- **Edge cases**: Must be tested (zero values, empty states, nulls)
- **Error conditions**: All error paths tested

## TDD Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ Write tests before implementation
- ✅ Make tests fail first
- ✅ Write minimal code to pass
- ✅ Refactor frequently
- ✅ Keep tests fast and isolated
- ✅ Test edge cases and errors
- ✅ Use descriptive test names
- ✅ Keep tests simple and focused

### Don'ts
- ❌ Write implementation before tests
- ❌ Skip the Red phase
- ❌ Write tests that always pass
- ❌ Test implementation details
- ❌ Create slow or flaky tests
- ❌ Skip edge case testing
- ❌ Write tests that depend on each other
- ❌ Test private/internal methods directly

## TDD Benefits

✅ **Better design** - Tests force clear interfaces
✅ **Documentation** - Tests document expected behavior
✅ **Confidence** - Refactor with confidence
✅ **Regression prevention** - Catch bugs early
✅ **Faster development** - Fewer bugs, less debugging
✅ **Maintainability** - Tests ensure code works as expected

## Integration with Atomic Design

- **Atoms**: Unit test each atom independently
- **Molecules**: Integration test molecule composition
- **Organisms**: System test organism behavior
- **Pages**: E2E test complete user flows
- Each level tested at appropriate granularity
- Tests follow same atomic hierarchy as code
