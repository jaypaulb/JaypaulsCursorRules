description: Command execution patterns. Use timeout for commands that don't self-terminate. All commands require error handling and validation. Apply when executing shell commands or running scripts.

# Command Execution Standards

> **Note**: See `core/command-execution.mdc` for complete guidelines. This is a minimal example.

## Core Pattern

**Commands That Self-Terminate** (most commands):
```bash
<command> 2>&1 | cat
```

**Commands That Don't Self-Terminate** (log tailing, watch, interactive):
```bash
timeout <duration> <command> 2>&1 | cat
```

## Requirements
- Use non-interactive flags (`-y`, `--yes`) where safe
- Use non-paging flags where safe
- Validate command outputs before proceeding
- Always check exit codes
- Capture stderr with `2>&1`
- **Use timeout only for commands that don't self-terminate**
- Pipe to `cat` to prevent paging

## Examples

**Self-Terminating:**
```bash
git status 2>&1 | cat
```

**Non-Terminating (needs timeout):**
```bash
timeout 30s docker logs --tail 100 -f container_name 2>&1 | cat
```
