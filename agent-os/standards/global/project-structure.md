# Project Structure Standards

Standardized project folder structure and organization standards. Keep root minimal, organize docs in docs/, structure source code logically.

## Root Directory Principles

- Keep root directory minimal and focused
- Only essential top-level files and primary folders
- All documentation moves to `docs/` folder
- README.md is the only documentation file in root

## Standard Root Structure

```text
project-name/
├── README.md                 # Project overview and quick start
├── docs/                     # All documentation
├── src/                      # Source code
├── tests/                    # Test files
├── scripts/                  # Build/deployment scripts
├── .cursor/                  # Cursor rules and config
└── [language-specific files] # package.json, requirements.txt, etc.
```

## Documentation Organization

```text
docs/
├── PRD.md                    # Product Requirements Document
├── TASKS.md                  # Task management and tracking
├── TECH_STACK.md            # Technology decisions and architecture
├── CHANGELOG.md             # Version history
└── assets/                   # Images, diagrams, mockups
```

## Source Code Organization (Atomic Design Hierarchy)

Structure code following atomic design principles - small, focused files that compose into larger logical groups (see `code-structure.md` for detailed rules, size limits, and composition guidelines):

```text
src/
├── atoms/                  # Basic building blocks (small, focused, single responsibility)
│   ├── user.py            # Basic user data structure
│   ├── validator.py       # Single-purpose validation function
│   └── logger.py          # Basic logging utility
├── molecules/              # Composed components (small groups of atoms)
│   ├── user_validator.py  # User validation (uses atoms/user, atoms/validator)
│   ├── auth_form.py       # Authentication form (uses atoms/user, atoms/validator)
│   └── api_client.py      # API client (uses atoms/logger, atoms/validator)
├── organisms/              # Complex modules (composed from molecules/atoms)
│   ├── auth_system.py     # Complete auth system (uses molecules/auth_form, molecules/user_validator)
│   ├── user_service.py     # User management service (uses molecules/user_validator, atoms/user)
│   └── api_handler.py     # API request handler (uses molecules/api_client, organisms/auth_system)
├── templates/              # Reusable patterns (structural templates)
│   ├── endpoint_template.py  # API endpoint pattern
│   └── service_template.py   # Service layer pattern
└── pages/                  # Complete features (composed from organisms/molecules/atoms)
    ├── login_page.py       # Complete login feature
    └── dashboard_page.py  # Complete dashboard feature
```

**Note**: See `code-structure.md` for file size limits, composition rules, and detailed guidelines.

## Testing Structure

```text
tests/
├── unit/                    # Unit tests
├── integration/             # Integration tests
├── e2e/                     # End-to-end tests
└── fixtures/                # Test data and fixtures
```

## Configuration Management

- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use `.env.example` to document required variables
- Separate config by environment (development.env, staging.env, production.env)
- Use consistent variable naming conventions

## Project Initialization Checklist

- [ ] Create standard folder structure
- [ ] Initialize README.md with project overview
- [ ] Create docs/PRD.md with requirements
- [ ] Create docs/TASKS.md for task tracking
- [ ] Set up .gitignore for language/framework
- [ ] Configure .cursor/rules/ with appropriate rule set
- [ ] Create .env.example with required variables
