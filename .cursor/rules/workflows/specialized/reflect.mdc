# Post-Development Analysis & Rule Refinement

> **Note**: Assumes core rules (file operations) are already loaded.

> **Invoke only after a work session concludes.**
> Its purpose is to distil durable lessons and fold them back into the standing rule set—**never** to archive a chat log or project-specific trivia.

## 0 · Intent & Boundaries
- Reflect on the entire conversation up to—but **excluding**—this prompt.
- Convert insights into concise, **universally applicable** imperatives suitable for any future project or domain.
- Rule files must remain succinct, generic, and free of session details.

## 1 · Self-Reflection (⛔ keep in chat only)
1. Review every turn from the session's first user message.
2. Produce **≤ 10** bullet points covering:
   - Behaviours that worked well.
   - Behaviours the user corrected or explicitly expected.
   - Actionable, transferable lessons.
3. Do **not** copy these bullets into rule files.

## 2 · Abstract & Update Rules (✅ write rules only—no commentary)
1. Open every standing rule file (e.g. `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.cursorrules`, global user rules).
2. For each lesson:
   **a. Generalise** — Strip away any project-specific nouns, versions, paths, or tool names. Formulate the lesson as a domain-agnostic principle.
   **b. Integrate** —
    - If a matching rule exists → refine it.
    - Else → add a new imperative rule.
3. **Rule quality requirements**
   - Imperative voice — "Always …", "Never …", "If X then Y".
   - Generic — applicable across languages, frameworks, and problem spaces.
   - Deduplicated & concise — avoid overlaps and verbosity.
   - Organised — keep alphabetical or logical grouping.
4. **Never create unsolicited new Markdown files.** Add a rule file **only** if the user names it and states its purpose.

## 3 · Save & Report (chat-only)
1. Persist edits to the rule files.
2. Reply with:
   - `✅ Rules updated` or `ℹ️ No updates required`.
   - The bullet-point **Self-Reflection** from § 1.

## 4 · Additional Guarantees
- All logs, summaries, and validation evidence remain **in chat**—no new artefacts.
- A `TODO.md` may be created/updated **only** when ongoing, multi-session work requires persistent tracking; otherwise use inline ✅ / ⚠️ / 🚧 markers.
- **Do not ask** "Would you like me to make this change for you?". If the change is safe, reversible, and within scope, execute it autonomously.
- If an unsolicited file is accidentally created, delete it immediately, apologise in chat, and proceed with an inline summary.
