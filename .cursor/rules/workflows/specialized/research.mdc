# Research & Design Methodology

> **Note**: Assumes core rules (file operations) and project rules are already loaded.

> **Invoke when starting a new project from scratch with brief context.**
> AI acts as strategic consultant, asking targeted questions to extract project requirements.
> Documentation (PRD, TECH_STACK, TASKS) is produced only at the final stage.

## 0 · Interactive Discovery Process

**User provides:** Brief project description or problem statement
**AI responds with:** 1-3 strategic questions to understand the core problem

### Q&A Format Rules
- **One question at a time** unless asking 2-3 linked questions on the same topic
- **Maximum 3 questions per response** - more becomes impractical to answer
- **Each answer influences the next question** - adaptive questioning based on responses
- **Total limit: 20 questions maximum** for the entire discovery process

### Question Categories (Adaptive Selection)
Based on user responses, select from these categories:
- Problem definition and scope
- Stakeholder and user identification
- Technical requirements and constraints
- Timeline and resource limitations
- Success criteria and metrics

## 1 · Adaptive Questioning Process

**AI follows this pattern:**
1. **Ask 1-3 strategic questions** based on current understanding
2. **Analyze responses** to determine next question category
3. **Adapt questioning** based on answers received
4. **Track question count** (max 20 total)
5. **Move to synthesis** when sufficient information gathered

### Question Selection Strategy
- **Start broad** (problem definition) then narrow down
- **Follow user's expertise level** - don't ask technical questions to non-technical users
- **Prioritize based on project type** - web app vs CLI tool vs API
- **Skip irrelevant categories** based on early responses

## 2 · Validation & Synthesis

**AI synthesizes all gathered information:**
- AI presents back a structured summary of all gathered information
- User confirms, corrects, or expands on any points
- AI identifies any gaps or inconsistencies that need clarification
- Final validation before moving to documentation phase

## 3 · Final Documentation Generation

**Only after complete discovery, AI generates comprehensive documentation:**

### Core Documentation Suite
Create comprehensive documentation in `docs/` folder:

#### PRD.md (Product Requirements Document)
- Problem Statement
- Goals & Success Metrics
- User Personas & Use Cases
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- Constraints & Assumptions
- Out of Scope

#### TECH_STACK.md
- Architecture Overview
- Technology Choices (Frontend, Backend, Database, Infrastructure)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADR format)

#### TASKS.md
- Phase 1: Foundation
- Phase 2: Core Features
- Phase 3: Integration & Testing
- Phase 4: Deployment & Launch

## 4 · Quality Gates & Deliverables

### Phase Completion Criteria
- [ ] Problem is clearly defined and validated
- [ ] Requirements are documented and prioritized
- [ ] Technology stack decisions are made and documented
- [ ] Project tasks are broken down and estimated
- [ ] Risks are identified with mitigation plans
- [ ] Success metrics are defined and measurable

### Documentation Quality Checklist
- [ ] All documents follow consistent format and style
- [ ] Cross-references between documents are accurate
- [ ] Decisions include rationale and alternatives considered
- [ ] Requirements are testable and measurable
- [ ] Assumptions are clearly stated and validated
- [ ] Documents are stored in proper `docs/` structure

## 5 · Transition to Development
- **Handoff preparation** — Ensure all documentation is complete and accessible.
- **Development environment setup** — Prepare tools, repositories, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Team alignment** — Brief development team on decisions and rationale.
- **First sprint planning** — Select initial tasks and establish development rhythm.

> **Next Phase:** Move to active development following task management and development standards.
