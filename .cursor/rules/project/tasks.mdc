# Task Management Standards

> **Note**: Assumes core rules (command execution, file operations, quality gates) and workflow rules are already loaded.

## Task Status Indicators
- `- [ ]` = Not started
- `- [🔄]` = In Progress (add Status: In Progress (Issue #X))
- `- [✅]` = Completed (add Status: Completed (Issue #X))
- `- [🚫]` = Blocked (add Status: Blocked (Issue #X))
- `- [⏳]` = Reserved (temporary state during reservation)

## Task Structure Requirements
Each task must include:
- Clear, actionable description
- Unique identifier (e.g., Task 1.2.3)
- Acceptance criteria
- Issue reference when work begins
- Estimated and actual time (when available)

## Task Completion Verification

### Before Marking Complete
- [ ] **TDD followed**: Tests written before implementation (see `tdd-methodology.mdc`)
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Quality gates passed (tests, linting, etc.)
- [ ] Test coverage >80% (100% for critical paths and public APIs)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated if required
- [ ] Issue closed or ready to close
- [ ] No known blockers or technical debt introduced
